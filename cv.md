**WORK EXPERIENCE**

*Reviews - Text engine | 2019-2020*
I wrote texts for reviews of products that were not popular. The work was rough and routine. I stayed there for a year. During this time, I learned how to interact with a team of people, mastered Excel.

*Grocery Store - Guard | 2020*
I had to go to work in the summer for a couple of months as a security guard in a store. In general, I did not learn anything useful from there. I just realized that I didn't want to make a living doing this kind of work, and after that I firmly decided to go into programming.

**Skills**
1) HTML
2) CSS/SCC
3) JS Basic
4) Gulp/Preprose
5) Cross-browser & adaptive website coding

**Goals**
My goal is to become a full-fledged Frontend programmer by the end of the year. I set this goal for myself last spring, but because of the events in the summer, I stopped studying for six months. Now I'm going to take care of myself and develop myself in js with new strength.
